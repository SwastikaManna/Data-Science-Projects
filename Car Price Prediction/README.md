# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting car prices is a crucial task in the automobile industry. Prices depend on various factors like brand reputation, features, engine power, mileage, and more. This project uses machine learning to train a model that can accurately predict car prices based on historical data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a machine learning regression model that predicts the price of a car based on multiple input features such as mileage, horsepower, brand, and other specifications.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Features may include**:
  - Car Brand / Model
  - Year of Manufacture
  - Fuel Type
  - Transmission
  - Mileage (km/l)
  - Number of Owners
- **Target**:
  - Selling Price

> *Dataset can be sourced from Kaggle, UCI, or scraped from OLX / CarDekho (if needed)*

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle null values
   - Convert categorical features
   - Remove duplicates
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Distribution plots
   - Feature importance
4. **Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   - Train-test split
5. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
6. **Evaluation**
   - RÂ² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
